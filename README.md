# HMMs for Language Modeling

Code for the paper

[Scaling Hidden Markov Language Models]()<br/>

EMNLP 2020


which trains HMMs with large state spaces for language modeling.

## Dependencies
* [TVM](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/install/from_source.html#developers-get-source-from-github) 0.7.dev1. This has a dependency on LLVM.
* Pytorch 1.5
* Torchtext 0.6.0
* Wandb 0.10.1

## Brown Clusters
The HMMs in this repository rely on Brown Clusters.
We include the Brown Clusters necessary for runnings the HMMs in the `clusters` directory.
To rebuild the clusters, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the Brown Cluster repo from
[github.com/percyliang/brown-cluster](https://github.com/percyliang/brown-cluster)
and install it locally following the directions in the repo.

2. Export `l_cluster` to the path of the `brown-cluster/wcluster` command,
installed in the previous step.
```
export l_cluster=/path/to/brown-cluster/wcluster
```

3. Preprocess the data by flattening the data.
The flattened data is only used for producing the Brown Clusters.
```
python scripts/preprocess_dataset.py
```

4. Run the Brown Cluster script to obtain clusters for PTB and WikiText-2.
```
bash scripts/brown_cluster.sh lm128
bash scripts/brown_cluster.sh w2flm128
```

## Very Large HMM (VL-HMM)

### Penn Treebank
To train a 32k state HMM on PTB, run
```
source scripts/hmm_commands.sh && run_ptb
```
An example run can be found [here](https://wandb.ai/justinchiu/hmm-lm/runs/1bkzvixn/logs).

### WikiText-2
To train a 32k state HMM on WikiText-2, run
```
source scripts/hmm_commands.sh && run_w2
```
An example run can be found [here](https://wandb.ai/justinchiu/hmm-lm/runs/1ciz3kxf/logs).
